# How can we change the current cell background of the cell being edited in .NET MAUI DataGrid?
In this article, we will show you how to change the current cell background of the cell being edited in [.Net Maui DataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-datagrid).

## C#
The below code illustrates change the current cell background of the cell being edited in DataGrid.
```
    public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
    {
        public MainPage()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            dataGrid.CellRenderers.Remove("Text");
            dataGrid.CellRenderers.Add("Text", new CustomTextRenderer());
        }
    }

    public class CustomTextRenderer : DataGridTextBoxCellRenderer
    {
        public override void OnInitializeEditView(DataColumnBase dataColumn, SfDataGridEntry view)
        {

            base.OnInitializeEditView(dataColumn, view);

            if (view != null && view is Entry entry)
            {
                entry.Background = Colors.SkyBlue;
            }

        }

    }
```
Please note that we have achieved this only for the DataGridTextColumn. If you need to achieve it for other columns, you will need to write the respective custom renderers.
